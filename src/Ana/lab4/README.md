## OOP Laboratory Work 4

#### TO DO:

**Advanced Level** (mark 7 || 8):
1. Write a program which would find if a mathematical expression is correct from the point of view of the parentheses within it (`hint` - use stack to store parentheses).

2. Read the expression from the file attached at this laboratory(`one_expression.txt`) and print the result if the parentheses are put correct in this expression.

**Advanced Level** (mark 9 || 10):
3. Do the same for a file with 3 expressions(`three_expression.txt`) in it and print in console information about all of them if the parenthesis in it are put correct. 

*One expression*

`2 * 4 + (3 +6 * 9 - 12 * (2*9 - 15)) + 2 +(-4)*((2 - 15))`

*Three expressions*

1. `2x - 3y + 25 / (2+5)*12 - ((29*4-2) + 32) -14`
2. `2x - 3y + 25 / (-((29*4-2) + 32) -14 - (2+5)*12`
3. `((((((((((((((((((((2x-4y * 98 )))))))))))))))))))))`
