## OOP Laboratory Work 4

#### TO DO:

**Advanced Level** (mark 7 || 8):
1. Write a program which would find if a mathematical expression is correct from the point of view of the parentheses within it (`hint` - use stack to store parentheses).

2. Read the expression from the file attached at this laboratory(`one_expression.txt`) and print the result if the parentheses are put correct in this expression.

**Advanced Level** (mark 9 || 10):
3. Do the same for a file with 3 expressions(`three_expression.txt`) in it and print in console information about all of them if the parenthesis in it are put correct.
